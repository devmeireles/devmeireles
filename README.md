## üßê About
Hi! I'm Gabriel Meireles, a software developer based in S√£o Paulo - Brazil. Over the past few years I've been involved in several small to large scale projects for various segments within and outside the technology industry.  
I started my career developing with PHP in which I work and worked with Laravel, Codeigniter, Zend, Lumen, Yii2, CakePHP and Symfony. In addition to PHP I also work with JavaScript using NodeJs for back-end applications and React and Vue.js for front-end applications and also mobile applications with React Native. I keep exploring new technologies and whenever possible writing with Golang and Python.
